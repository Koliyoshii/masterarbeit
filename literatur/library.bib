   abstract = {In this paper we present the first published end-to-end production computer-vision system for powering city-scale shared augmented reality experiences on mobile devices. In doing so we propose a new formulation for an experience-based mapping framework as an effective solution to the key issues of city-scale SLAM scalability, robustness, map updates and all-time all-weather performance required by a production system. Furthermore, we propose an effective way of synchronising SLAM systems to deliver seamless real-time localisation of multiple edge devices at the same time. All this in the presence of network latency and bandwidth limitations. The resulting system is deployed and tested at scale in San Francisco where it delivers AR experiences in a mapped area of several hundred kilometers. To foster further development of this area we offer the data set to the public, constituting the largest of this kind to date.},

   abstract = {<p>Augmented Reality (AR) is worldwide recognized as one of the leading technologies of the 21st century and one of the pillars of the new industrial revolution envisaged by the Industry 4.0 international program. Several papers describe, in detail, specific applications of Augmented Reality developed to test its potentiality in a variety of fields. However, there is a lack of sources detailing the current limits of this technology in the event of its introduction in a real working environment where everyday tasks could be carried out by operators using an AR-based approach. A literature analysis to detect AR strength and weakness has been carried out, and a set of case studies has been implemented by authors to find the limits of current AR technologies in industrial applications outside the laboratory-protected environment. The outcome of this paper is that, even though Augmented Reality is a well-consolidated computer graphic technique in research applications, several improvements both from a software and hardware point of view should be introduced before its introduction in industrial operations. The originality of this paper lies in the detection of guidelines to improve the Augmented Reality potentialities in factories and industries.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Due to the popularity of indoor positioning technology, indoor navigation applications have been deployed in large buildings, such as hospitals, airports, and train stations, to guide visitors to their destinations. A commonly-used user interface, shown on smartphones, is a 2D floor map with a route to the destination. The navigation instructions, such as turn left, turn right, and go straight, pop up on the screen when users come to an intersection. However, owing to the restrictions of a 2D navigation map, users may face mental pressure and get confused while they are making a connection between the real environment and the 2D navigation map before moving forward. For this reason, we developed ARBIN, an augmented reality-based navigation system, which posts navigation instructions on the screen of real-world environments for ease of use. Thus, there is no need for users to make a connection between the navigation instructions and the real-world environment. In order to evaluate the applicability of ARBIN, a series of experiments were conducted in the outpatient area of the National Taiwan University Hospital YunLin Branch, which is nearly 1800 m2, with 35 destinations and points of interests, such as a cardiovascular clinic, x-ray examination room, pharmacy, and so on. Four different types of smartphone were adopted for evaluation. Our results show that ARBIN can achieve 3 to 5 m accuracy, and provide users with correct instructions on their way to the destinations. ARBIN proved to be a practical solution for indoor navigation, especially for large buildings.</p>},

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

   abstract = {<p>Augmented Reality (AR) is the evolution of the concept of Virtual Reality (VR). Its goal is to enhance a person's perception of the surrounding world. AR is a fast growing state of the art technology and a variety of implementation tools thereof exist today. Due to the heterogeneity of available technologies, the choice of the appropriate framework for a mobile application is difficult to make. These frameworks implement different tracking techniques and have to provide support to various constraints. This publication aims to point out that the choice of the appropriate framework depends on the context of the app to be developed. As expected, it is accurate that no framework is entirely the best, but rather that each exhibits strong and weak points. Our results demonstrate that given a set of constraints, one framework can outperform others. We anticipate our research to be the starting point for testing of other frameworks, given various constraints. The frameworks evaluated here are open-source or have been purchased under Academic License.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Current AR systems only track sparse geometric features but do not compute depth for all pixels. For this reason, most AR effects are pure overlays that can never be occluded by real objects. We present a novel algorithm that propagates sparse depth to every pixel in near realtime. The produced depth maps are spatio-temporally smooth but exhibit sharp discontinuities at depth edges. This enables AR effects that can fully interact with and be occluded by the real scene. Our algorithm uses a video and a sparse SLAM reconstruction as input. It starts by estimating soft depth edges from the gradient of optical flow fields. Because optical flow is unreliable near occlusions we compute forward and backward flow fields and fuse the resulting depth edges using a novel reliability measure. We then localize the depth edges by thinning and aligning them with image edges. Finally, we optimize the propagated depth smoothly but encourage discontinuities at the recovered depth edges. We present results for numerous real-world examples and demonstrate the effectiveness for several occlusion-aware AR video effects. To quantitatively evaluate our algorithm we characterize the properties that make depth maps desirable for AR applications, and present novel evaluation metrics that capture how well these are satisfied. Our results compare favorably to a set of competitive baseline algorithms in this context.</p>},

This paper presents an empirical analysis of the positional accuracy of location data gathered using a high-sensitivity GPS-enabled mobile phone. The performance of the mobile phone is compared to that of regular recreational grade GPS receivers. Availability of valid GPS position fixes on the mobile phones tested was consistently close to 100% both outdoors and indoors. During static outdoor testing, positions provided by the mobile phones revealed a median horizontal error of between 5·0 and 8·5 m, substantially larger than those for regular autonomous GPS units by a factor of 2 to 3. Horizontal errors during static indoor testing were larger compared to outdoors, but the difference in accuracy between mobile phones and regular GPS receivers was reduced. Despite the modest performance of A-GPS on mobile phones, testing under various conditions revealed that very large errors are not very common. The maximum horizontal error during outdoor testing never exceeded 30 metres and during indoor testing never exceeded 100 metres. Combined with the relatively consistent availability of valid GPS position fixes under varying conditions, the current study has confirmed the reliability of A-GPS on mobiles phones as a source of location information for a range of different LBS applications.</p>},

The main focus of the AR feature is to superimpose 3D models of historical buildings in their past state onto the real world, while users walk around the Venetian part of Chania’s city, exploring historical information in the form of text and images. We examined and tested registration and tracking mechanisms based on commercial AR frameworks in the challenging outdoor, sunny environment of a Mediterranean town, addressing relevant technical challenges. Upon visiting one of three significant monuments, a 3D model displaying the monument in its past state is visualized onto the mobile phone’s screen at the exact location of the real-world monument, while the user is exploring the area. A location-based experience was designed and integrated into the application, enveloping the 3D model with real-world information at the same time. The users are urged to explore interest areas and unlock historical information, while earning points following a gamified experience.
